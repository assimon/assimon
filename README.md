Yes, that's right，I am a software engineer，Working on go language software development。   

But at the same time I also like python and php. Recently I am learning Vue.js and Node.js。

My favorite band is Linkin Park, The city where I live has pandas🐼，and my favorite food is hot pot 🍲(because I live in Sichuan, you know)。

How about you?
